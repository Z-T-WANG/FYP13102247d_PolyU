Applied phyiscs department BSc 13102247dFYP

This was initiated as a final year project of Wang, Zhikang in Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Applied Physics Department, Engineering Physics BSc programme.

The very first documentation can be found in the Methodology chapter of FYPreport13102247d.doc at the root of "backup-upon-FYPreport-submission" branch, and the general process to develop this program is also introduced there.


Update since the backup branch:

2017/May/9
To complete the notification functionality to explain how to use this program within itself, a new class, notification, was completed. Put a struct array which contains text, where to show the text, where to use an arrow to prompt, to implement this class in different physics demonstrations. However, a bug appeared and this program cannot run after being packaged, though it runs correctly in Unreal editor. The bug does not seem to be solved and therefore the progress is paused here. It has been posted onto Unreal AnswerHub https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/597917/4152-packaged-build-crash.html
